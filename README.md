## Usage

- Starting at the base folder of the project, execute the instruction `cd Project`
- Then, execute the instructions `chmod +x makeit.sh breakit.sh`
- Now that the permisions have been granted, the program may be compiled with `./makeit.sh`
- Finally, the program may be executed with `java L0int`  
- If, for matters of compression, you wish to decompile the code and delete all the .class files, you may execute the instruction `./breakit.sh`
